### 1.1 - Description


### 1.2 - Data Overview


| Attribute | Description |
| :----- | :----- |
| Id | an Id that represents a (Store, Date) duple within the test set |
| Store | a unique Id for each store |
| Sales | the turnover for any given day (this is what you are predicting) |
| Customers | the number of customers on a given day |
| Open | an indicator for whether the store was open: 0 = closed, 1 = open |
| StateHoliday | indicates a state holiday. Normally all stores, with few exceptions, are closed on state holidays. Note that all schools are closed on public holidays and weekends. a = public holiday, b = Easter holiday, c = Christmas, 0 = None |
| SchoolHoliday | indicates if the (Store, Date) was affected by the closure of public schools |
| StoreType | differentiates between 4 different store models: a, b, c, d |
